	        	<h1>Bibi van der Velden</h1>
	            Bibi is a sculptor and a jewellery designer in her own right. Born in New York, raised in the UK and Holland, she graduated in fine arts from the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague and perfected her goldsmith techniques in Schoonhoven, The Netherlands. This background was a powerful foundation for her later creative expressions, and inspired her to adapt and adopt different cultures, customs and craftsmanship into her designs.<br /><br />
				Bibi has boundless energy and a strong sense of adventure. In her search for the perfect materials for her art, she has found herself sleeping in a train through Rajasthan, sailing down a river in Bangkok, swimming by Komodo dragons in Indonesia and acquiring a mammoth tooth in Northern Siberia. Her sense of fun and sharp appreciation of everyday beauty, mixed with a love for travel and sculptural form; has fuelled Bibi's designs into globally acclaimed and desired works of art.<br /><br />
				At Amsterdam Fashion Week 2006 Bibi launched, her jewellery line; Wearable Works of Art, where she applied her experience as a sculptor to mould her jewellery. Now Bibi successfully supports four different lines; a natural evolution of Wearable Works of Art consisting of Haute Couture pieces mostly created with antique objects. The Fine Jewellery line, formed in 18 ct yellow gold and white gold, with diamonds and precious stones.<br /><br />
				The more recent Mammoth line is created out of a 40,000 years old mammoth tooth discovered beneath the Siberian ice and carved into rings and pendants. 
				Bibi's most recent collection is her Pr&ecirc;t-&agrave;-Porter line in sterling silver line carrying, for instance, sign language necklaces available in each letter of the alphabet as pendants.<br /><br />
				Since founding Wearable Works of Art in Amsterdam, the brand has spread to London, Paris, Italy, Spain, Tokyo, Singapore and the United States. 
				Organised by gallery owner Ron Mandos in their own workspace Studio White Space Bibi and her mother will show the results of an intensive period working, contemplating, confronting and creating together.<br /><br />
				Confronting Time visualises the elusiveness and transience of time itself and the effect this phenomenon can have on the viewer. 
				For the first time, Bibi fused together with her mother as BibiMich&egrave;le, will present an exhibition of artworks that were created as one.<br /><br />
				Bibi will always be Bibi, but today, through this extraordinary collaboration; she is also BibiMich&egrave;le.

	        	<h1>Mich&egrave;le Deiters</h1>
				For those who have the need to create, the greatest challenge and ultimate inspiration is found in the art and craft of sculpting.
				To confront and master a stone evokes passion, fear, intuitive mathematics and extraordinary projective vision - it also demands endurance and humility.
				<br /><br />
				Mich&egrave;le travelled from a young age and went to school in Switzerland, followed by a year in Rome to study Art History. Mich&egrave;le then went to a kibbuts in Israel, but her stay was cut short by the yom kippur war when she was trapped in a bomb shelter for several weeks.
				<br /><br />
				Since childhood Mich&egrave;le Deiters knew that beauty lies in every stone, her working life has been devoted to creating and discovering, perfecting and liberating, beauty from stone.
				Mich&egrave;le's dream began to come true when she was awarded the privilege of an apprenticeship for two years as the pupil of one of the Netherlands most acclaimed sculptors, Nico Onkenhout.
				After further immersion in the craft of sculpting at the London Art Schools City and Guilds she attended the London
				polytechnic to perfect her welding. then for two years Mich&egrave;le yellow cabbed between the New York National Academy and her studio on East 77th Street.
				While her confidence and desire for greater challenge increased; her scope was limited by what she was literally able to hoist up the stairs!
				<br /><br />
				Italy thus provided, in one great two years long rush of adrenaline, the creative inspiration and giant stones of marble and alabaster that Mich&egrave;le, had until, then been denied.
				Returning to the Netherlands with her growing family; Mich&egrave;le established her studios in Utrecht and in France called le Chambon. Commissions began to be fulfilled for companies and collectors.
				<br /><br />
				Mich&egrave;le draws great inspiration from her travels around the world and is truly a global citizen, avant la lettre.
				Throughout her life Mich&egrave;le has always followed her heart, and her inspiration is driven by love and friendship.
				<br /><br />
				Since 2005 she embarked on a new source and depth of inspiration that stems from working with her daughter Bibi, with whom she started their studio called White Space and in le Chambon, together. Now, 4 years later, like her daughter Bibi, she is BibiMich&egrave;le.

				<h1>Like a shell - Jan Cremer</h1>
				Like a shell both parts combine into one.<br />
				Or like a swan that glides over water chased by her young.<br />
				Proud, wise mother and impatient daughter with a thirst for life.<br />
				Both peering across the sea, while watching the shore. Curiously searching and always restless. This is how I see Mich&egrave;le and Bibi.
				<br />
				Both devoted to Art, both equally craving the ultimate form of creation. Two kindred spirits joined in power and creativity. All passion surrendered to the thirst to create. It's not unusual for the son of an artist to follow in his father's footsteps, sometimes this appears inevitable. While most remain in the shadow, condemned to dance around the volcano, it is still rarer for a daughter to follow her mother into art.
				Mich&egrave;le and Bibi are two muses in Art.<br />
				From an early age the daughter was led by the hand of her mother and learned to watch in silence and awe. Just as she learned from teachers at the art academies. Learning to see. Because people look at sculptures but often fail to see them. Now they compliment each other and dance a duet of invention. Stimulating each other with ideas, their connection stronger than ever.
				<br />
				Isolated and undisturbed in rural France where thoughts are only interrupted by the chirping of crickets.<br />
				Where nothing distracts from work. With iron discipline they both seek to capture the sacred silence forever and transform it with form and sculpture.<br />
				Wrestling together in marble and stone, to master them while burning with the will to create.<br />
				Challenging each other to greater accomplishments. Two minds, two spirits surrounded by clay.<br />
				Together creating sculptures, in a sea of deafening silence and calming turbulence.<br />
				Like a shell.

				<h1>Bibi on Mich&egrave;le</h1>
				My earliest memories were of watching my mother work. They include the sound of the chisel chipping. The scratching of charcoal and the heat of the foundry. There wasn't an idea or project that she didn't involve me in.<br />
				When I could walk I would fetch a hammer, later I would help polish marble or wash the alabaster forms that she was creating.<br />
				When I was 8, I wrote in my school note book that I wanted to become an artist one day.<br />
				I was brought up by Mich&egrave;le with the trust and belief that anything is possible.<br />
				Starting with clay then soft stone I began to explore shapes for myself.<br />
				My involvement in the studio evolved as I did.<br />
				When I began at the Art Academy I was in full-flow with my own ideas and also enjoyed experimenting in non 3 dimensional media. In the evenings I developed my craft knowledge to facilitate my love for Jewellery design.<br />
				My mother and I founded Studio White Space and worked there together apart. Each busy building her own body of work.<br />
				A sounding-board starts as a confirmation of ones thoughts and getting back a little kick to continue - that is how my working relationship with Mich&egrave;le began.<br />
				My role graduated from sounding board into that of "second opinion" and now, proudly, it is an equal partnership based on unconditional trust and mutual respect.<br />
				We challenge each other in a way that we are able to extend our boundaries in a creative and conceptual way.<br />
				The time we spent together creating "Confronting Time" became a platform where any of the distractions that come with the "mother daughter" relationship just flood away to create a level playing field for our work.

				<h1>Mich&egrave;le on Bibi</h1>
				From the age of eight, Bibi was with me while I was working. Our collaboration was raw and instinctive. Bibi's enthusiasm fuelled me. Her interest prompted her to join me on visits to the bronze foundry. Bibi started experimenting with materialising ideas at 12. I began to introduce her to tools, techniques and materials. Her fresh, unconventional eye delighted and fascinated me. Our partnership today was already developing organically. 
				<br /><br />
				Bibi took a gap year in Florence. She went to learn Italian and study art. Her creative coming of age was evident, as her confidence in her capabilities grew and she learned to translate ideas into tangible forms. 
				<br /><br />
				Bibi has always been wary of making the wrong decisions; the idea that choosing would exclude other possibilities, leading to regret. This was manifest when she decided to pursue her love of art at the Gerrit Rietveldt Academie while at the same time to read law at the University of Amsterdam. 
				<br /><br />
				After her foundation year at the Rietveldt Academy she switched to the more relevant Royal Academy of Art in the Hague. Law studies made way to focus on art. 
				<br /><br />
				By night Bibi also studied to be a goldsmith and started turning antique objects into jewellery. It was a way to express herself with her familiar "precious personal objects" ardently collected over the years. This became a powerful medium for her creative energy. She began to receive significant commissions, prompting her to design jewellery professionally. Her boundless energy enabled her to complete the Art Academy while developing an increasingly acclaimed career as a jewellery designer. Her infectious drive and energy have always astonished and inspired me.

					Mother and daughter, lauded Sculptor and acclaimed multimedia designer. Experience and optimism. Serenity and fire. Wisdom and why? United in the quest for conceptual perfection, quality, evocation and meaning, together with the combined ferocity of their execution.
					<br /><br />
					White Space Studio Amsterdam, where Bibi and Mich&egrave;le work together and apart, along with their mid-forest retreat. Le Chambon in France's Dr&ocirc;me departement hosted the many, many hours that brought this collection to fruition.
					<br /><br />
					"Confronting Time" seeks to do exactly that. To literally explore perspectives of time; time past, time eternal, time perceived, time frozen, time shared and so on, influenced by its inevitability and transience.
					<br /><br />
					"Confronting Time" comprises of a series of mixed- media artworks and installations where the viewer is confronted with themselves through reflection and abstracted traditional forms applied through contemporary materials.
					<br /><br />
					Bibi said "we capture and freeze moments in time" Mich&egrave;le continued " to first confront the viewer then provoke them to reflect on the many facets of 'real' and perceived time."<br />
					Bibi and Mich&egrave;le struck an effervescent equilibrium that strengthened their abilities to explore further their own conceptual and creative processes while fusing their individual experiences and disciplines. "We became "BibiMich&egrave;le" they exclaimed.
					<br /><br />
					Their work reflects the contradictions in the ebbing and flowing of time itself in all its human manifestations.
